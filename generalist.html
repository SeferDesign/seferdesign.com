			<p>We hate most email lists, so we do our best to make this one as engaging and worthwhile as possible. We respect your inbox. <strong>We have no intention of spamming you.</strong> We only send a list when we feel we have enough interesting content to warrant one. This usually occurs once per month.</p>
			<p>Questions, concerns, and interesting links can be directed to <a href="mailto:generalist@seferdesign.com" target="_blank">generalist@seferdesign.com</a>. GeneraList is edited by Robert Sefer, proprietor of <a href="{{ "/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Sefer Design Co</a>.</p>
