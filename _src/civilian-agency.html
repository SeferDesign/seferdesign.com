<h1>Personality Through Animation</h1>
<p>When considering a re-design for their web site, <a href="http://www.civilianagency.com/" target="_blank">Civilian Agency</a> faced a problem: "How do we translate our culture and world-class design sense?" They had a beautiful vision for what they wanted to site to look like, but didn't have the ability to turn it into a functioning product. That's when the Chicago-based brand marketing agency gave Sefer Design Company a call.</p>

<p>The design team had developed a clean, modern aesthetic that looked incredible on paper but was missing the one ingredient most important to them: motion. What better way to demonstrate the firm's personality than with animation?</p>
<p>In the past, complicated animations could be achieved through the use of Adobe Flash, an <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/" target="_blank">old, cumbersome technology</a>. However, among other caveats, it didn't work on mobile phones. In today's smart phone-first landscape, Flash isn't a viable option. Thanks to modern web standards, animations can now work on any device &mdash; mobile and desktop &mdash; and provide interactions with users.</p>

<p>In collaboration with the Civilian design team, we built a collection of fun, eye-catching animations that are peppered throughout their site. Without being intrusive, they add the little bit of "extra" the agency needed.</p>

<p>When building a web site, a delicate balance between clarity and personality is necessary. Presenting relevant information in it's simplest form is usually desirable, but sometimes a splash of life is required. The little things, done correctly, can do quite a bit of heavy lifting. Our work with Civilian Agency achieves just the right mixture and goes a long way in presenting the firm's culture to the world.</p>
