When we started in this business, the web looked very different than it does today. All these years later, the thing that seems to have the most staying power is the rate of change. Every day, some new technology claims to be the next "best" thing. *It will revolutionize everything!* Some do, of course, but most fall into obscurity, quickly replaced by the next attempt, and the next, and so on. As the old saying goes, however, the more things change, the more they stay the same. The world around us may change, but our principles do not.

**We focus on simple, clear outcomes.** We prioritize all decision-making towards the stated goals. If a particular choice doesn't move us closer, we reconsider.

**We are cautious technologists.** We love technology and don't shy away from new tools, new methods, or new styles. But we understand what works, why it works, what's a risk worth taking, and what's not. Our guidance leans toward proven, flexible solutions.

**We are honest with ourselves, and with you.** We know what we're good at and what we aren't. Our best projects involve a lot of discussion with you about what is to be accomplished. Inevitably, this requires an intense focus on goals and a willingness to let lesser priorities take a back seat.

**We are resourceful optimists.** You know your business better than anyone else ever will, us included. Despite this fact, we think we can offer guidance you may not be familiar with. We've yet to find a business we can't add value to. [But don't take our word for it](/case-studies/).

Do you have a project in mind? [Get in touch](/contact/). We're excited to hear what challenges you'll throw at us next.
