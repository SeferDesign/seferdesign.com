	<h1>Behind the Scenes of Sefer Design Co.</h1>
	<p>We firmly believe that great design works much like great style &mdash; it may fade in and out of fashion, but it always feels right on the person wearing it. When we sat down and examined our old brand look, we realized it leaned heavy on the "fashion" and lacked the timeless style we strive for. Our old identity may have worked in the moment, but it no longer reflected our opinions and capabilities. It was time for a big change. We set out to create a new look and feel that made us proud, one that is reflective of who we are and who will be. Here's how we did it.</p>

		<p>Nowadays, company logos appear on phones, laptops, projector screens, business cards, t-shirts, coffee mugs, and who knows what else in the future. Our logo needed to be versatile, appearing legible on any medium, now and always. Our eyes tend to lean settle on stark contrast and in the case of our own brand, we stuck to it. After some thought (and some input from the crowd), we decided on a text-only logo in medium-to-heavy weight. Simple black on a white background in most uses cases, but with the ability to appear boldly white on top of most colors. (We field-tested this &mdash; to great success &mdash; with a <a href="https://mailchi.mp/9a36a4b5f86b/thank-you-happy-holidays-from-sefer-design-co" target="_blank">holiday t-shirt</a>!)</p>

	<p>With a rock solid logo finished, we started to think about our values. Not "values" in the corproate-speak</p>
